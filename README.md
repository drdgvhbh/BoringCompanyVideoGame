# The Boring Company Video Game

The Boring Company Video Game is a comedy game based on the Boring Company itself, Bitcoin memes, and Elon Musk memes. Players control tracks of simulated routes between cities in California; the goal is to spend "fake bitcoins" to upgrade and maintain the tracks before they get over congested. Everything a car collides with another car, it will start honking and the company's approve rating goes down. The game ends when the company's approval rating reaches 0.

This project was a group collaboration made using Unity in two weeks.
